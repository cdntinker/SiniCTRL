# Yes, I know this is the fugliest code ever seen.

Just as a starting point, I've never been much good with UI programming.

To make it worse, I have absolutely no experience with Python.

# OTOH...

It seems to work.

It's hard coded to work on MY network with MY SiniLinks...

# To Be Done

At startup, they all show "wtf" by default.

The first time a button is pressed, an ON command is sent.

This is not optimal...
